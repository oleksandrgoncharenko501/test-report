2. Found issues
BUG: Article could be created with empty mandatory fields

3. Why automated
Main functionality in blog is ability to create and delete article, thats why these functionality was chosen for testing.
Positive cases were covered in UI part.
Positive + Negative tests were covered in UI +  API parts.
It was done based on testing pyramid => less UI more API tests
